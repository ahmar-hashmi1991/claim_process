To communicate between the claimProcess service and the payments service, we can use a messaging system such as a message queue. Here's a pseudocode example illustrating how they could communicate:

# claimProcess service

# After computing the net fee for a claim
net_fee = compute_net_fee(claim)

# Publish the net fee to a message queue for the payments service to consume
message_queue.publish("payments_queue", net_fee)

# Log the successful publication of the net fee
logger.info("Net fee published to payments queue: %s", net_fee)


# payments service

# Consume net fees from the message queue
while True:
    net_fee = message_queue.consume("payments_queue")
    
    # Process the net fee (e.g., initiate payment to the provider)
    process_payment(net_fee)

    # Log successful payment processing
    logger.info("Payment processed successfully for net fee: %s", net_fee)

In this setup:

1. The claimProcess service computes the net fee for a claim and publishes it to a message queue (payments_queue).
2. The payments service continuously consumes messages from the payments_queue.
3. Upon receiving a net fee message, the payments service processes the payment (e.g., initiates a payment to the provider).
4. If there's a failure in either service, the message queue ensures that messages are not lost. Failed messages can be retried later.
5. Multiple instances of either service can be run concurrently to handle a large volume of claims. The message queue will distribute messages across consumers (instances of the payments service) for processing.

This approach decouples the claimProcess and payments services, making them more resilient to failures and scalable to handle large volumes of claims.
